<!--1. Dictionary definitions and Generative Geert definitions compared-->
<div style="width: 90%;">
    <h3>Tinkering is widely associated with trial-and-error and brainstorming.  Find dictionary definitions of the three techniques, and compare them. Does the definition of tinkering match the definition we have in the course? Also, ask a generative AI tool for the definitions and differences. Which aspects does the answer provided miss?</h3>
    <p>Tinkering, trial-and-error and brainstorming are compared here according to two different sources; for the dictionary definition the Cambridge Dictionary was used, and as I try to avoid using generative AI I asked a friend for their definitions of the three terms.</p>

      <div class="column" style="width: 40%;">
        <p>I like G's approach of putting repairing and repurposing into the same category of "changing the current functionality"'. Otherwise, these definitions match quite well, and from both you can conclude that of the three terms, 'Tinkering' is the only one that, by definition, starts with an existing artefact.</p>

      <div class="column" style="width: 40%;">
        <p>A noticable difference is that C emphasises learning from mistakes that were made, whereas G sees the 'trials' as seperate events that are executed until one appears to work. In my interpretation, trial-and-error is at least partly implicit in both tinkering and brainstorming.</p>

        <p>I think G makes a good point in putting emphasis on building off of each other's ideas, which C omits. I would also say this is a key part of the definition, otherwise it would be a room of individuals writing down their thoughts instead of a group brainstorming. This makes this the only term of the three which is by definition group-based.</p>

  <!--2. A typical project-->
  <div style="width: 90%;">
    <h3>Can you take a typical I-Tech related project case, list and explain 5 technical hurdles? To which extent do they allow for a 'tinkering' approach in tackling them? Please give arguments.</h3>
        <p>
            To fit with my education I will take a typical IDE case; the first project of the bachelor, designing a lamp for a student room, using one square meter of sheet metal, an LED strip, and loose materials we could find around the workshop. 
        </p>
    <h4>Hurdles</h4>

    <h5>Lack of experience working with sheet metal</h5>
        <p>
            The tinkerability was greatly increased by using stiff paper to make prototypes, as technically every fold you make with paper should be reproducible in sheet metal. This did give us a kind of tinkering approach, where the affordance of paper to be easily folded allowed us to try out the producibility of various ideas. 
        </p>

    <h5>Thinking in terms of target groups</h5>
    <p>
        I think this is something that is hard to approach from a tinkering perspective. It is very intangible, and I do not think the problems that result from this are very well addressed by a tinkering approach. It is probably possible to create a session in which participants can somehow do something tangible and reach some conclusion about their target group, but crucially I do not think this would be more effective than “simple” desk research or questionnaires.
    </p>

    <h5>Lack of experience with integrating electronics into products</h5>
    <p>
        At first glance, it seemed like our electronics were as tinkerable as possible - something that is literally plug and play, and can be stuck to anything: an LED strip. However, since we could only stick it on once, we ended up not using it in the design process, only in the manufacturing of the prototype.
    </p>

    <h5>Lack of knowledge about mass production</h5>
    <p>
        I believe making this tinkerable is what is happening now at the Cube. However, at the level of a first years, first project student, I would think considering this is still too much. In any case, it does not really make sense to approach mass production from a tinkering perspective, as it is not something that is usually considered in the phase where tinkering would be most useful. Basically, anyone who really needs to worry about mass production will be familiar with existing, “boring” methods that should suffice for most situations.
    </p>

    <h5>And more general hurdle in design, described mostly by systems engineering: interfaces between various parts of a system</h5>
    <p>
        Systems engineers have already produced some tools which allow interfaces and system components to become not only visual, but also comprehensive (see, for example, the A3AO). If a transformation to a functional, physical, tinker-y tool can be made, I think systems engineers would be very happy; since a big reason for making such things explicit and visible is exactly so that their validity, possible problems, and alternatives can be discussed. In this very rigid discipline, tinkering might actually have quite a reasonable place.
    </p>

   <!--3. Tinkerspiration -->
   <div class="column" style="width: 90%;">
    <h3>Where would you go hunting for tinkerspiration? List 5 physical and 5 online resources valuable for an I-Tech specialist. In which did you already find inspiration for a project you did or that got on your bucket list?</h3>
    
    <div class="column" style="width: 50%;">
    <h4>Physical</h4>

    <h5>Thrift stores</h5>
        <p>
            Whether I am already looking for (part of) a solution, or just for any kind of inspiration, perusing thrift store shelves is always a good idea, especially the electronics part and the shelf (they almost always have this one) where all the undetermined mechanical things are. 
        </p>

    <h5>The Design Lab "mystery wall"</h5>
    <p>
        Very similar to the thrift store, except the stuff is free! 
    </p>

    <h5>Bits and bobs drawers (see tinkering spaces)</h5>
    <p>
        Through the years, I have gathered spare parts into my various drawers (spare buttons in the sewing drawer, spare springs in the mechanical drawer, found potentiometers in the electronics drawer, etc.). These are very nice to have when looking for okay-ish solutions for personal projects.
    </p>

    <h5>Book: “Over de werking van de kurkentrekker en andere machines”</h5>
    <p>
        A very nice book filled with illustrations of cool mechanisms, I do not really use it when looking for a specific solution but just skim through it from time to time to enjoy the designs, which can then later pop up when I am looking for something specific.
    </p>

    <h5>The garage</h5>
    <p>
        The bits and bobs drawer, but on a larger scale. 
    </p>

    <p>Lastly; Just living life and finding problems without solutions or solutions without problems, and mentally filing them away for later use.</p>
</div>

<div class="column" style="width: 50%;">
    <h4>Online</h4>

    <h5>Youtube</h5>
        <p>
            Similar to the book I mentioned; I mostly just watch stuff that interests me about all kinds of topics, and quite often, when looking for some solution, a memory of a specific video activates. 
        </p>

    <h5>Marktplaats</h5>
    <p>
        A good few of my projects are bargains I got on Marktplaats that were “for the hobbyist”. Sometimes the repair is successful, sometimes the bits and bobs drawer gets some new spare parts..
    </p>

    <h5>Forums</h5>
    <p>
        Most niche topics have a forum somewhere, and most of the time someone encountered the same problem or had the same ides as you in 2007. I love these little bastions of knowledge hidden away on the internet.
    </p>

    <h5>Google</h5>
    <p>
        An obvious answer, but a search engine really is always the first online tool I go to. Avid chatGPT users seem to forget how useful a well-worded google search is, so I thought it relevant to include.
    </p>

    <h5>Reddit</h5>
    <p>
        When I cannot find a forum for the topic I am working on, doing a google search and adding “reddit” has done wonders. 
    </p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="column" style="width: 60%">
  <h3>List 5 domains, challenges or settings in which you would like to apply tinkering, and explain why. Can you identify some sweet spots, (perhaps beyond the well-known such as STEM education) and can you also define some limitations? Are there 'untinkerable' domains?</h3>
    <h5>Cooking</h5>
    <p>
        I think cooking, if you are trying to have a little fun with it, is about experimenting, taking knowns and unknowns and mixing them, using parts of recipes and adjusting them to your taste. I think it is already quite tinkerable, and an explicit tinkering approach might make it just that bit more approachable. 
    </p>

    <h5>Music</h5>
    <p>
        In this case, music is actually remarkably similar to cooking!
    </p>

    <h5>Visible mending</h5>
    <p>
        Visible mending is about taking something (clothes, usually) that is somehow damaged or broken, and celebrating the fact that you are willing to repair it, using the opportunity to make something more personalised and unique. It is already about combining materials, ideas. Some kind of tinker-y mending kit for people who are not familiar with sewing could be great.
    </p>

    <h5>Writing</h5>
    <p>
        A very iterative and, especially in the beginning, random process, combining inspiration from all kinds of sources. Again, I would say it is somewhat similar to music and cooking.
    </p>

    <h5>Room layout</h5>
    <p>
        This one is more personal perhaps. I love messing up the layout of my room from time to time (it is after all just one space where I have to fit all my stuff and activities). Something small scale that allows me to mess around with, and really get a feel for, various layouts would be very nice. Nothing I have tried yet works very well for this (short of just starting to move stuff).
