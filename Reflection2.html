<h3>Material Table Criteria</h3>
<p>Here, I will explain what criteria I used for my material table criteria. They might seem quite similar, but are distinct in important ways. I would say that, when choosing a material for your tinkering session, these three are absolutely crucial to get right (while there are, of course, others). They are all rated 1-5.</p>
<p>Intuitiveness: How easy is it to use the materials for the intended goal without instruction? (note: a low grade for this can probably, in most cases, be solved by proper instruction, but for this table I am rating the materials on their own) </p>
<p>Affordance: How well does this material allow the user to do something which they otherwise would not have been able to do; how well does it emulate a function and make it accessible?</p>
<p>Approchability: How likely is someone to be comfortable with using the material; does it look too precious to handle or too complicated to even try, or does it invite you to pick it up?</p>
<p>Tinkerability: conclusion, rating is not necessarily the average</p>
