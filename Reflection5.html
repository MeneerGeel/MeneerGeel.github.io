    <h4>Tinkering is a way to generate knowledge. What kind of knowledge results from a tinkering process in your experience?</h4>
        <p>I do not think a tinkering process produces knowledge in the traditional sense, but very specific tangible results, produced, more or less, randomly. If these results are documented and analysed, I would definitely see this as a type of useful knowledge.</p>
    
    <h4>Tinkering with classical materials like clay, paper, colour, textiles is more related to craft. How does tinkering work with digital and electronic media?</h4>
        <p>You would need to design the session in such a way that working with tangible things becomes possible; these are the technical hurdles to be addressed.</p>

    <h4>One basic characteristic of science is reproducibility. Is that possible with tinkering? Or do we want that at all?</h4>
        <p>Somewhat. There is no predefined goal, but the same session could be held over and over. As opposed to traditional experiments, though, there is a very low probability that the same result will come up. However, this is also true for many design (research) processes, and I would say tinkering is more in this category than that of traditional ‘science’.</p>

    <h4>Design practice changed during the past years, from long design phases to short, iterative processes, due to the availability of new prototyping technologies. Is this iterative process of prototyping qualitatively different from the cycles we do in tinkering?</h4>
        <p>I think this is a bit of a leading question; it depends highly on what type of design we are talking about. For graphic design, or form design, design cycles have not necessarily become shorter, people have just started moving from tangible work (paper and foam) to screens earlier in the process.</p>
        <p>However, to answer the question: yes, I would say there is a difference. In my experience, even in an iterative process of short prototyping cycles, every prototype gets an evaluation, leading to requirements for the next prototype. Thus, there are still clear distinctions between prototypes and phases, which I feel are intentionally blurred in tinkering</p>

    <h4>Can a co-design session be described as a tinkering session as we treat it in our course?</h4>
        <p>Depending on the type of co-design session, definitely! I think this happens in practice already.</p>      

    <h4>The choice of materials (seed, tools, scaffolding, facilitation) has an effect on the outcome, the knowledge and products made in a tinkering session. How can we use that in a co-design session? Can we really influence the kind of results here, and do we want that?</h4>
        <p>Of course. I would say that not only can you influence the results, you inevitably do so, and as such it is better to do it consciously and be aware of how you are influencing them.</p>
        
    <h4>In “research through design” can tinkering fill in the design part?</h4>
        <p>Sure it could, as said above, the design part is already the non-reproducible (or at least hard to reproduce) part, so I do not think swapping it for tinkering would in that sense be a problem. If it helps the researcher (when they or people they want to involve are not trained as a designer for example) I would not see why not.</p>

    <h4>Are there design questions where tinkering is not a possible or useful approach?</h4>
        <p>If the question is very specific, then tinkering is probably not the best approach. If the problem is specific but the answer can still be very open (top-down), then tinkering could be suitable. If there is no problem yet but a new technology is looking for applications (bottom-up), I would say tinkering could be very useful!</p>

    <h4>Read Invent to Learn page 41. how to balance real-world (criticality) with the fruitful mindset of tinkering?</h4>
        <p>I do not see why a fruitful mindset and criticality need to be opposed to each other; as long as I have known, these are both crucial in different phases of the design process (perhaps this is part of the reason I like separating them clearly).</p>

     <h4>What is the critical impact your tinkering exercise could have? (on you, your design/engineering practice or problem, both positive and negative)</h4>
        <p>I think the most important thing to consider here is that people who would normally not participate in critical design can be given the tools to do so in a tinkering session. In this way, the impact can be quite significant and extend beyond a single designer.</p>
