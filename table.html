      <tr>
        <td class="tg-0lax">Story cubes</td>
        <td class="tg-0lax">4 – I think this material makes excellent use of humans’ innate affinity for storytelling and pattern seeking, minimal instruction should be needed</td>
        <td class="tg-0lax">3 – When starting a creative process, having any kind of seed planted is often the key, and this can help with that. However, if someone is not creatively confident, they might still have a hard time with this</td>
        <td class="tg-0lax">5 – invoking the classic dice image, I don't see anyone hesitant to throw them around as intended or confused about this function</td>
        <td class="tg-0lax">4 – I think this is a great way to apply tinkering to the domain of storytelling</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td class="tg-0lax">Totem maker</td>
        <td class="tg-0lax">3 - It took us some messing around, but it was fairly easy to understand at least the basic structural mechanism. However, depending on the target group, I don’t see people quickly building robots without a fair bit of instruction</td>
        <td class="tg-0lax">2 – It is definitely easier to build a robot with this than with actual industrial materials. However, the amount of technical knowledge/insight required to do so is still, I think, substantial</td>
        <td class="tg-0lax">2 – I think the need to cut plastic inhibits this point quite a lot. It is nice when you have a more defined idea of what you want to make, but for the ‘messing around’ phase, less so</td>
        <td class="tg-0lax">2 – I think this material is more suitable for defined prototyping than for tinkering</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td class="tg-0lax">Maker beam</td>
        <td class="tg-0lax">3 – Similar to the totem maker; fairly easy to see the basic attachment methods, but that doesn’t mean one can build amazing things straight away</td>
        <td class="tg-0lax">2 – Also, the same problem as the totem maker, the process is made slightly easier, but there is still a lot of knowledge required</td>
        <td class="tg-0lax">3 – This is better than the totem maker, as there is no need to cut. Still, making the structure you want takes some planning, as nuts and bolts need to go in in a planned order, otherwise you might need to take everything apart again.</td>
        <td class="tg-0lax">2 – Again, I think this is better as a prototyping material</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td class="tg-0lax">Arduino starter kit</td>
        <td class="tg-0lax">1 – If you are unfamiliar with this system, it is very unlikely that you will be able to do anything with it without instruction</td>
        <td class="tg-0lax">4 – After some use, also considering the amount of resources available, there is a lot of potential</td>
        <td class="tg-0lax">2 – The material is not overly precious, but also not inviting when unfamiliar</td>
        <td class="tg-0lax">2 – On its own, this is also better for prototyping</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td class="tg-0lax">Sparkfun inventor</td>
        <td class="tg-0lax">1 – see Arduino</td>
        <td class="tg-0lax">4 – See Arduino</td>
        <td class="tg-0lax">2 – See Arduino</td>
        <td class="tg-0lax">2 – See Arduino</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td class="tg-0lax">LEGO</td>
        <td class="tg-0lax">5 – I expect everyone to be able to figure out how LEGO bricks go together, and to be able to make something with them</td>
        <td class="tg-0lax">4 – LEGO makes it quite easy to create things that stay together as intended</td>
        <td class="tg-0lax">4 – The bricks are generally satisfying to use, and easy to take apart and reassemble again and again</td>
        <td class="tg-0lax">5 – A material known by almost everyone, usable in many different settings.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td class="tg-0lax">Group 15’s wind power tinkering materials!</td>
        <td class="tg-0lax">3 – Not everything is intuitive, but most of the connectors do quite clearly interact with the mast material</td>
        <td class="tg-0lax">4 – The kit certainly gives someone the ability to create a wind-harnessing contraption with relative ease</td>
        <td class="tg-0lax">3 – The amount of different materials might be overwhelming, but the kit is set up so that all components can easily be taken apart and readjusted</td>
        <td class="tg-0lax">3 – not perfect yet, but a nice start in harnessing the wind</td>
