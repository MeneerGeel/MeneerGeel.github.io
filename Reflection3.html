    <h3>Take a look at the LEGO serious play method. Take a look at the sections discussing facilitation - Do adults need a different approach or role in facilitation? Which concepts are relevant?</h3>

        <p>The introduction of the book makes clear that the reason LEGO serious play exists is essentially to get adults ‘back’ into a child’s mindset, and this seems to be the core of the idea. I find it interesting that perhaps the facilitator’s most important role is to provide a sort of encouragement. “The facilitator’s most efficient tool ... is to ask questions and show genuine interest”. So the most efficient thing they can do is not to bring exactly the right materials, or give the perfect instruction, but to make the adults in the room feel heard, to make them feel comfortable with essentially letting out their inner child. Very interesting, and – I imagine – very relevant for any tinkering workshop.</p>
    
    <h3>Read Invent to Learn chapter 5. Summarise the key principles mentioned by Papert and also the key principles by Montessori. Where do Papert and Montessori meet up? What is a fundamental difference in their approach? How well do their mantra's and thoughts on teaching translate to tinkering for 'children of different ages'?</h3>

        <p>There is no mention of Montesorri in this chapter, so I am not sure how to make a comparison. Papert’s points, however, can be briefly summarised as follows;</p> 
            <p>1.	it is good for you to do things and make things, instead of/in addition to hearing about things.</p>
            <p>2.	Hard is not (by default) bad, easy is not (by default) good. Sometimes having to put in the work makes for a better experience. </p>

    <h3>Read Invent To Learn chapter 9. What are useful pointers for the space (location) and setting, what is the message? Do you need a designlab/fablab?</h3>

        <p>Leaving aside copy-pasting the literal recommendations made in this chapter, I think the other points that are important to consider:</p> 
             <p>1.	Neutrality of the space. The text only mentions gender, but I would say there are all kinds of (accidental) biases to consider in this case.</p>
            <p>2.	Make sure you are not asking people (kids in the text) do work with something that you as a facilitator are not familiar with. </p>
            <p>3.	Make sure that the space can be used in a flexible way, to allow for flexible group dynamics</p>
            <p>4.	The space should ultimately make sure that complexity is made accessible (arguably one of the main goals, if not the main goal of tinkering).</p>

        <p>Lastly, of course you do not NEED a fablab; any space exists on a spectrum between the hypothetical worst and best tinkering space, and any space can be used to improvise, and to make it as suitable to your tinkering need as possible.</p>

    <h3>Now get back to your own practice as a designer/engineer:</h3>
        <h4>Where in a process do you use tinkering?</h4>
            <p>Considering tinkering as it is presented in the course, I think I actually barely use it at all for design projects. For me, it is very useful to make hard distinctions between design phases, and to be very aware which one I am in. This does not mean I follow them in a neat order, but the way I am working depends on which phase I consider myself to be in (the other way around, if I notice myself working in a certain way, I might realise I need to go to a different phase). In tinkering, these distinctions seem to fade. For personal projects, though, I would say I almost always use tinkering.</p>

        <h4>How can you translate a design problem or research problem into a tinkering playground?</h4>
            <p>To fit tinkering into my typical way of working, it would make most sense to use tinkering as a method of co-design, to get input for the diverging ideation phase.</p>

        <h4>What can you use to get unstuck?</h4>
            <p>This depends too much on the type of problem to give an overall answer; for me it could be anything from talking to the right person to taking a walk to finding a youtube video, or even just taking a break and trying again.</p>
        
        <h4>How do you get in the flow?</h4>
            <p>Just by working on something that really interests me and is somewhat novel, in a comfortable space.</p>
